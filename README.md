Do competition pilots follow lifty lines away from the task track?

We are going to look at sets of tracks from the lead competition pilots following tasks 
who would normally go direct to each turnpoint by the shortest line.

There's a theory that some of them can "pick a good line" which is much less sinky and 
fly off the direct line, but save on later thermalling. This project looks for the evidence.

For extra points, we could implement the [GAP scoring system](https://www.fai.org/sites/default/files/documents/annex_24b_-_proposal_scoring.pdf) thing.

We need tracks for the UK nationals in Laragne from Phil.
